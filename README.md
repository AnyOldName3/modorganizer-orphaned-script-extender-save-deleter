# Orphaned Script Extender Save Deleter
Mod Organizer plugin to delete orphaned script extender co-saves

## Installation
Just put the `.py` file in your Mod Organizer plugins directory.

## Usage
Choose this plugin from the Mod Organizer Tools dropdown and click 'Okay' until it's done, reading the text that pops up if you feel like doing that, too.

## Translating this
I guess I'll put this on Transifex if anyone actually uses this.
Just ask me if it's not done and you want it done.
